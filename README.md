# OCTCode
image processing pipeline for OCT image scans, uses openCV libraries

# OCTDepthPipeline
-detects y displacement between lines

# OCTWidthPipeline
-detects x distance between edges of lines

# BoundaryTest
-detects more organic shapes to varying degrees of succes, depends largely on prefiltering and thresholding
-OTSU auto thresholding exists but I have had much success with it
